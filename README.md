tests-postgres-hardening
=====================

This are the integration tests for the projects

- https://github.com/hardening-io/puppet-postgres-hardening
- https://github.com/hardening-io/chef-postgres-hardening

they start at `integration` level

you can use the gem `kitchen-sharedtests`

- https://github.com/ehaselwanter/kitchen-sharedtests/

to make them available to your project. Use `thor kitchen:fetch-remote-tests` to put the repo into `test/integration`

## Standalone Usage

you can target the integration tests to any host were you have ssh access

rake -T gives you a list of suites you can run (well ignore directories which are obviously not suites for now)

```
Â± rake -T
rake serverspec:default    # Run serverspec suite default
```

run it with:

```
bundle install

# default user and ssh-key

bundle exec rake serverspec:default target_host=<name-or-ip-of-target-server>

# or with user, host, password

ASK_LOGIN_PASSWORD=true bundle exec rake serverspec:default target_host=192.168.1.222 user=stack
```

add `format=html|json` to get a report.html or report.json document
